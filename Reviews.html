    <td>My time at Funday Holiday Park was alright but it could've been alot better. I decided go camping instead of staying in a caravan, however my major complaint is that the water was located so far away from the camping site. There also weren't many entertaining activities I enjoyed.</td> <!--This is the review text in the table-->
